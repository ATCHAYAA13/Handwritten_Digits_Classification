# Handwritten Digits Classification

This project focuses on classifying handwritten digits using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**. The dataset used is the well-known **MNIST dataset**, which consists of 70,000 images of handwritten digits (0-9). The goal is to demonstrate how deep learning can be used to achieve high accuracy in image classification tasks.

## Overview

This project uses a CNN to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. CNNs are widely used in image processing due to their ability to capture spatial hierarchies in images. The model is trained to recognize features of digits and predict the correct label.

## Dataset

The MNIST dataset contains:
- **Training set**: 60,000 images
- **Testing set**: 10,000 images

Each image is a 28x28 grayscale image of a single digit between 0 and 9.

## Model Architecture

The model is built using the **Keras** library with a **TensorFlow** backend. The architecture includes:
- **Input Layer**: 28x28 grayscale images
- **Convolutional Layers**: To detect image features
- **MaxPooling Layers**: For down-sampling
- **Fully Connected Layers**: To map the extracted features to the digit classes
- **Output Layer**: 10 output nodes (for digits 0-9) with softmax activation

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook (optional)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ATCHAYAA13/Handwritten_Digits_Classification.git
    cd Handwritten_Digits_Classification
    ```

2. Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python scripts to train and evaluate the model.

## Usage

To train the model, run:
```bash
python train_model.py
```

To predict a digit using a custom image:
```bash
python predict.py --image_path path_to_image
```

## Results

The model achieves:
- **Training Accuracy**: ~99%
- **Validation Accuracy**: ~98%

Sample predictions:
- Input: Digit 7 → Predicted: 7
- Input: Digit 4 → Predicted: 4

## Conclusion

This project illustrates the use of CNNs for classifying handwritten digits with high accuracy, showcasing the potential of deep learning in solving image classification problems.
